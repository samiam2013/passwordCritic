# Types for me, not necessarily for thee

I'm keeping my bloom filter in here - want to keep it separated from the actual logic of the password critic, testable on it's own, separable for re-use in the future, etc.

I'm also going to keep my custom errors in this folder out of the way so they don't get lost in the logic.
